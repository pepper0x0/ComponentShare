## 📝 Naming Conventions

Please follow these naming conventions for your files and folders to maintain consistency and clarity:

- **Code Files:** Use camel case (e.g., `LandingPage001.jsx`, `Footer001.jsx`). Choose the next available number as subscript and start coding!
- **Assets:** Name your asset files descriptively, followed by their type (e.g., `LP001_1.jpg, LP001_2.jpg` (these are for LandingPage001.jsx) for images).
CSS and other files go into the respective folders and use the same naming format as the code files.


## ✨ Contributing Guidelines

1. Add your code to the **right folder** based on its type (e.g., `buttons/`, `cards/`, `footer/`, etc.).
2. Use the specified naming conventions for folders and files.
3. Document your code **clearly** so others can easily understand and reuse it.
4. Test your code before submitting to ensure it works properly.
5. Add a comment at the top of each file describing it briefly, name of the component, tech used, your social links(optional) and authorName/username. Example:
  
  // Futuristic landing page component: LandingPage001, TechUsed: 'React, TailwindCSS', name: 'Minimalist Landing Page'author: 'Sky', githubLink: 'https://github.com/skycypherxo'
