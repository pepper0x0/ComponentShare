## 📁 Project Structure

Here’s the structure of the project. Ensure that you place your files in the correct folders and follow proper naming conventions:


. ├── assets/ ├── buttons/ │ ├── button_assets/ │ ├── button_code_files/ │ └── button_css/ ├── cards/ │ ├── card_assets/ │ ├── card_code_files/ │ └── card_css/ ├── footer/ │ ├── footer_assets/ │ ├── footer_code_files/ │ └── footer_css/ │ └── Footer001.jsx ├── landingPage/ │ ├── landing_page_assets/ │ ├── landing_page_code_files/ │ ├── landing_page_css/ │ │ ├── LP001_1.jpg │ │ └── LP001_2.jpg │ └── LandingPage001.jsx ├── login/ │ ├── loginPage_assets/ │ ├── loginPage_code/ │ └── loginPage_css/ ├── navbar/ │ ├── navbar_assets/ │ ├── navbar_code_files/ │ └── navbar_css/ ├── pages/ │ ├── ButtonShowcase.jsx │ ├── CardsShowcase.jsx │ ├── FooterShowcase.jsx │ ├── HeaderShowcase.jsx │ ├── LandingPageShowcase.jsx │ └── LoginSignupShowcase.jsx ├── App.css ├── App.jsx ├── Home.jsx ├── index.css └── main.jsx



## 📝 Naming Conventions

Please follow these naming conventions for your files and folders to maintain consistency and clarity:

- **Code Files:** Use camel case (e.g., `LandingPage001.jsx`, `Footer001.jsx`). Choose the next available number as subscript and start coding!
- **Assets:** Name your asset files descriptively, followed by their type (e.g., `LP001_1.jpg, LP001_2.jpg` (these are for LandingPage001.jsx) for images).
CSS and other files go into the respective folders and use the same naming format as the code files.


## ✨ Contributing Guidelines

1. Add your code to the **right folder** based on its type (e.g., `buttons/`, `cards/`, `footer/`, etc.).
2. Use the specified naming conventions for folders and files.
3. Document your code **clearly** so others can easily understand and reuse it.
4. Test your code before submitting to ensure it works properly.
5. Add a comment at the top of each file describing it briefly, name of the component, tech used, your social links(optional) and authorName/username. Example:
  
  // Futuristic landing page component: LandingPage001, TechUsed: 'React, TailwindCSS', name: 'Minimalist Landing Page'author: 'Sky', githubLink: 'https://github.com/skycypherxo'
